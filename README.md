Agile Roles Randomizer
=============

This is a small randomizer app for choosing common Agile roles for each iteration (i.e. Scrum Master or Release Manager). It is fully customizable via its interface - once you've put down all settings you can copy the link on settings page, which will contain JSON in GET parameter. Once you open this link you'll see all your settings loaded. You can open this project on stackblitz: https://stackblitz.com/github/deniskond/agile-roles-randomizer and serve it online.
